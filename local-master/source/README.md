**Dynamix Local Master**

Dynamix local master supports detection of the local master browser in an SMB network.
It will display <img src='/webGui/icons/localmaster.png'> in the header at the top-right when unRAID is elected as local master browser.

Under SMB Workgroup settings more information about the current elected local master browser is given.
