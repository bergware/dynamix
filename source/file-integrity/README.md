**Dynamix File Integrity**

Real-time hashing and verification of files stored on the data disks of the array. This plugin reports on failed file content integrity and detects silent file corruption (aka bit-rot).

This is a GUI front-end to the script *bunker* which is used to calculate checksums based on SHA2, MD5 or BLAKE3 and runs in the background.
It allows the user to set up quickly a protection scheme without the need to use CLI or CRON jobs herself/himself.
